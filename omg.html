            <p>Hello OMGers! This page is intended to be used for all members of OMG who are interested in maximizing their online tools that they are already put money into. As you guys have more requests for tools, I will build them. This website does not cost you anything now, and it will not cost you anything in the future... Everything is Free. As much as OMG has given me, I am doing my best to give back. If you absolutely moved by the resources that I build over time, feel free to donate to the cause. :) Cheers!</p>
