            <h2>Social Media Management</h2>
            <p>The process of keeping up with Facebook and Twitter can be overwhelming. If you don't post often enough you are missing the opportunity to draw in current and new customers. If you spend time posting content each day you are taking away from your business. We can help you by alleviating the responsibility of posting relevant and shareable content on Facebook and Twitter. We will post once a day on each platform. What! Once a day! That is a lot!</p>
            <p>Let me explain the process that Facebook has implemented. They will throttle each one of your posts on your page. This means that if you want to reach all of your followers, you can either boost (pay Facebook) or hope that it gets shared like crazy. By posting each day we will increase the likelyhood that one of your followers will see your post and will share the content, bringing in more clients. When Facebook throttles your post, only a small percentage will see your post. Posting once daily meets the needs to boost your profile and drive business. Twitter does not throttle your tweets. Posting multiple times on Twitter each day is not a problem and does not drive customers away. It is a micro sharing platform that encourages consistent contact.</p>
            <p>We will create unique posts each time that will be relevant to your business. These posts will be shareable and will contain stories that relate to your business. We won't post weekly specials, coupons, or other types of offers that your business might want to promote. We leave those to you so you can still manage direct contact type posts. The more shareable content is the more likely you are to generate new customers.</p>
