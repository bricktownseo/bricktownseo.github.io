            <h2>Oklahoma City SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h2>
            <p>Search engine optimization is the process of building your online profile so that your company shows as high as possible when your customers are "Googling" for you.  This comes in a combination of many different things from page evaluation on your website, to google places, Facebook pages and other social media strategies. This service is performed continuously to maintain the highest ranking positions possible.</p>

            <h2>Custom Web Plugins</h2>
            <p>When you use web content management systems (CMS) like Wordpress, they can get you 90% of the way to a complete and functioning website. The remaining 10% is typically accomplished through plugins. We can generate custom plugins for your company to accomplish the specialized features needed for your website. We also build Chrome and Firefox plugins for your business needs.</p>
