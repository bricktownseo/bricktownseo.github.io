###Web Design / Search Engine Marketing
Beyond being at the top of Google and the other search engines, having a pretty and user friendly website that converts visitors to customers is the second most important part of internet marketing. Bricktown SEO has the best designers who are capable of generating everything from Logos and branding material to a responsive website design tailored specifically to your requirements. We also provide print shop friendly proofs for any printed materials. We are your one stop shop for design.

####Pay Per Click Advertising
We have found most SEO companies offering ranking are actually selling PPC (pay per click) advertising to their clients instead. There are great examples of when PPC advertising is the right fit for a company and we are happy to explore those options with you. In general, we focus on ranking organically and not in Pay Per Click advertising. We have partnered with an awesome Google Partner in the OKC Metro who can help take your ad campaigns to their maximum potential. 

####Business Consulting  
As online marketers, we have the fortunate opportunity to work with many different industries and professions. We have a strong knack for filtering out the best ROI and how to strategize and take your business to a profitable level you have not previously thought possible. We offer many subsets of services from one time business analysis to continued consultations on a monthly basis.

#####Custom Development / Plugins
We are experts at ranking and one of the largest reasons for this is all employees have a technical degree and background in computers / IT. Many on the team are programmers who offer project planning, management, and coding of various size projects. We can help guide you through the process of hiring an individual or team of programmers to complete your custom software project as well as build your specifications and implement your project.
