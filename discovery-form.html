Bricktown SEO is NOT For all businesses.<br><br>
Here are businesses that we can help:<br><br>
            We would love to help everyone that has requested our expertise as the word is out after we have assisted many businesses to achieve high-levels of success. We select the clients we work with very carefully and have a reasonable set of criteria that needs to be met in order for us to proceed. We only work with a limited amount of clients at any given time to ensure maximum attention to detail and your company’s ultimate success.<br><br>
Here it is:<br><br>
1. You have an Active and Healthy business already.<br><br>
Our services are for companies that are up and running already and simply want to move a lot faster and a lot farther. <br>
            Bricktown SEO does not work with:<br><br>
A. Get Rich Quick Schemes, MLM (Multi Level Marketing) Schemes<br><br>
B. Adult Themed Material<br><br>
C. Early Stage Start Ups<br><br>
2. You should have a steady flow of leads and customers. This means that you’re getting consistent traffic and making sales already. You’re running ads, you’re promoting, and you’re selling your services. You don’t have to be a household name …You just need to be PRESENT in your market.<br><br>
3. You must have a good, solid product and a good reputation. Everything we do together will not only be bringing you more sales and profits, but we’ll be doing it in a way that creates MASSIVE goodwill in your market.<br><br>
That’s it! Those are all our requirements.<br><br>
If you meet the criteria above and would like to speak with us personally about getting you incredible results, then we will happily set aside some time for you. Here’s how the process works: First, you’ll need to fill the discovery form below.<br><br>
Don’t worry, it’s simple and unobtrusive. We just need to know what you’re selling, get an idea of what you want to accomplish, and so forth... We’ll review your goals, your offers, and so forth and we’ll deliver a custom plan to grow your revenues... based on the exact same process that’s generating millions for our clients right now. Your initial call will be between 45 and 60 minutes.<br><br>
