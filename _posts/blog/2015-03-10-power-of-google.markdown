It is amazing how many times when I talk to local businesses that they tell me they don’t have the time or resources to make an impression online…

Your business can not ignore the power of the internet. Whether you are a carpenter or an online marketer the internet is powerful for everyone.  At a minimum your local business needs to make sure they have their online citations setup properly. <!--more-->

A citation is a listing of your business name, address, and phone number. They need to match 100% every single time. When they do not match, Google in particular does not give you credit for the mismatch. Citations that are 100% identical gives you more authority to rank higher.

Secondly, a local business needs to make sure their Google, Apple Maps listing, Yelp, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, Youtube, …. are all matching citations and pointing back to their website. Any discrepancy here devalues your data for your company.

A client of mine who was unsure of the power of Google and the internet in general reluctantly allowed me to bring their business online. The difference it has made is amazing. They are so very happy for the volume of phone calls and the placement that they are receiving. It has transformed their business and now they are trying to figure out the right way to grow.
