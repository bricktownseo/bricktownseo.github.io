SEO is search engine marketing. Simply put it, SEO is the process of optimizing your on-site and off-site content in order to get you the highest position for your keywords for your website. This can come in the form of optimizing anchor text, H1 tags, meta data, social media profiles, and guest posts on other websites. 

Anchor text is the text you see inside of a link. For an example, let's say you want to link to google.com, but you want the link to say "The Greatest Seach Engine EVER!!!" This would be your anchor text. Inside of the HTML you would write:

<code>
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;The Greatest Search Engine Ever!!!&lt;/a&gt;
</code>

The result of the above HTML is the following link.

<a href="http://www.google.com">The Greatest Search Engine Ever!!!</a>

H1, H2, H3 tags are Header tags. They are special tags that have an effect on the size of text. The other effect of this is that search engines use this for keyword type content. What this means is that your H1 text is given a higher weight than your regular body text. Below is the example code and the associated output.

<code>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a H1 tag.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is a H2 tag.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This is a H3 tag.&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>

<h1>This is a H1 tag.</h1>
<h2>This is a H1 tag.</h2>
<h3>This is a H1 tag.</h3>

These are just some of the examples of the work that is performed in the process of perfecting the SEO for a website. If you would like us to give you a free analysis of your website, give us a call and we would be happy to help you see where your website is placing.
