            <h2>Mobile Friendly</h2>
            <p>Starting April 21st, Google is going to give preference to sites that are mobile friendly. This will cause a direct impact to traffic and ultimately the bottom line for many websites. You NEED to be mobile friendly. Forget that the Google smackdown is coming, do you know that more than 60% of web traffic today is from mobile devices. Think about it. When you want to find a plumber, painter, dentist, or other service professional where do you look? You are likely using Google. On top of that most people are going to pull their iPhone or Android out of their pocket and search right now. This is why it is SOOOO important to be <strong>Mobile Friendly</strong>. Below you will see a couple of examples. I chose the Dallas market as not to draw attention to a local Oklahoma City company. If you do nothing in the next 30 days but make your website mobile friendly you are headed in the right direction. Do you know if you are ready for #mobilegeddeon?

            <h3>Pediatric Associates of Dallas | <span class="text-danger">Not Mobile Friendly</span></h3>
            <a href="http://paddallas.com/" target="_blank">Website</a><br>
            <p>I found their website with a quick Google of "Dallas Peds" and did a quick mobile analysis and found that they are not ready for the mobile-friendly era. I will be contacting them to let them know that they need to fix this but they are still a great example.</p>

            <a href="http://www.dallascosmeticdentist.us/" target="_blank">Website</a><br>
            <p>I found their website with a quick Google of "Dallas Dentist" and found that they are ready for the mobile-friendly era. They also are in the number one position for Dallas Dentist and are doing very well in terms of SEO.</p>
