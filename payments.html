        	<h3>Setup your SEO Billing</h3>
        	<p>
        		Below you will find a button labeled "Setup Account". Use this button to fill out your credit/debit card information for billing. Once you have setup your card we will attach your subscription to card and apply any onetime SEO fees that we will have already discussed with you. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you.
